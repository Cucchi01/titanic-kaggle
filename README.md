# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
## Kaggle competition
---
This is a Kaggle competition based on the data avaible from the Titanic disaster. The aim is to predict from the information on the passanger if he survived. 
The data regarding the passangers are partitioned in two.
In the data folder there are some files that are provided from the competition and some that are generated by the code in the [main.py](/main.py) file.
Some important files are:
- [train.csv](/data/train.csv) contains the data of most of the passangers and if they survived
- [test.csv](/data/test.csv) contains the data of the rest of the passangers and we have to predict if they survived
- [gender_submission.csv](/data/gender_submission.csv) is a possible submission that predict the outcome using only the sex attribute
- [results.csv](/data/results.csv) is a possible solution generated by the code in the 
- [main.py](/main.py) contains the code I used to generate the predictions
